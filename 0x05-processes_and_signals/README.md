## Introduction

Processes and signals are fundamental concepts in Unix-like operating systems. A process is an instance of a running program, and understanding how processes are managed, created, and terminated is essential for system administrators and developers alike. Signals are software interrupts that can be sent to processes to notify them of events or request certain actions.

This repository aims to provide examples and explanations of various concepts related to processes and signals, covering topics such as process management, signals handling, and inter-process communication.

## Contents

The repository is organized into several directories, each containing examples and explanations of specific topics:

- **01_process_management:** Examples illustrating process creation, termination, and management using system calls like `fork`, `exec`, and `wait`.
- **02_signals:** Examples demonstrating how to handle signals in Unix-like operating systems, including basic signal handling, sending signals between processes, and handling specific signals.
- **03_interprocess_communication:** Examples showcasing different mechanisms for inter-process communication, such as pipes, message queues, shared memory, and sockets.

## Usage

To use the examples in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/0x05-processes_and_signals.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing the example you're interested in:

   ```bash
   cd 0x05-processes_and_signals/01_process_management
   ```

3. Read the source code and accompanying documentation to understand how the example works and how to compile/run it.

4. Compile the example (if necessary) using the provided build instructions.

5. Run the compiled executable to observe the behavior described in the documentation.

Repeat these steps for other examples or directories as needed.
